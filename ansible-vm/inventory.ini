# Example inventory file for Ansible
# You can use this file or pass the host directly in the command

[servers]
# Example with a single server
# Add ansible_become_pass=YOUR_SUDO_PASSWORD to this line, or run playbook with -K to be prompted
remote_server ansible_host=X.X.X.X ansible_user=user ansible_password=password ansible_become_pass=password!

# Example with multiple servers
# server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.100 ansible_user=admin ansible_password=password123
# server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.101 ansible_user=admin ansible_password=password123

# NOTE: For security, it's better to use ansible-vault to encrypt passwords
# Or use a password file: ansible_ssh_pass=password123 (not recommended in production)

# Example with group variables
[servers:vars]
# ansible_user=admin
# ansible_password=password123
# ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
